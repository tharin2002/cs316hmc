	\brief Hybrid Memory Cube Functional Simulation Library Header File
	
	The HMC_SIM library is a standard C library that provides functional
	simulation support for an arbitrarily configured Hybrid Memory Cube
	device.  This libraries enables users to experiment with various
	HMC configurations in order to perform research in available bandwidth, 
	memory addressing, connectivity and general simulation archictecture.
